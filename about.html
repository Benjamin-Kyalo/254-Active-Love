      Introducing "254 Active Love": Where Compassion Fuels Change! Founded in
      2021, this community-based organization (CBO) is the collaborative effort
      of Jack, Ricky, Stephanie, and Benjamin and others. They came together
      with a shared vision: to create a ripple effect of positivity that starts
      with the youngest and most vulnerable among us. <br />Since its inception,
      254 Active Love has been a force for good, channeling the generosity of
      the community to uplift children's homes in need. Through tireless efforts
      and unwavering dedication, the CBO organizes regular donation drives,
      collecting essential items such as clothing, school supplies, hygiene
      products, and toys, ensuring that every child feels cared for and
      supported. <br />254 Active Love isn't just a charitable organization;
      it's a familyâ€”a tight-knit community of volunteers, donors, and advocates
      united by a common purpose: to make a meaningful difference in the lives
      of others. Together, they stand as living proof that when people come
      together with love in their hearts, there's no limit to what they can
      achieve. <br />Join 254 Active Love as they continue to spread love, hope,
      and positive change throughout the community. Together, they're building a
      brighter future, one act of kindness at a time.
